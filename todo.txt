Thomas ideas:

A few ideas

**definitely**

- Change request event, like the current bug event, which pulls a card from its current position, even finished, back to start.
--> difference is, it is an added story, not a recycled story, it takes BA time, it doesn't have a money decrease, but rather an increase.... although it does delay the completion bonus. Has different symbology/description. (How to trigger it, without worrying about a race condition regarding completion bonus?)

- Special abilities which you unlock over time and obtain charges of in some way, purchasing or as rewards, such as Bug Bash to rapidly get through a stack of bugs, or Mercenary which brings in a high-level super contractor for a single sprint.

--> bug bash... like a bonus round
--> 

- Occasional Tenders, which are like boss fights compared to normal projects. You have to put together the tender somehow, perhaps it's like a normal project but instead of rewarding money it rewards a tender application score that determines whether you win the tender. The tender itself is then a bigger more challenging version of a project with better rewards.

--> a tender item pays no money along the way, and only pays money if you win the tender and complete the project, but the project pays a premium (to make up for the tender cost)



**probably not**

- At the end of each project you choose a go live party option (random multiple activities with different costs), the option you pick determines the morale boost each employee gets in the first sprint of the next project.

- Adding complexity to above: each employee has activities they like (extra boost) and dislike (no boost).


- Traits for employees, so when choosing employees to hire you have to balance their salary, traits and current level. For example devs can have a Cowboy trait that increases dev speed but also bug chance. No stats like Game Dev Story, an employee just has a level and their traits.


DEFER

 ?  is there inflation?
		each time a thing is purchased, that thing becomes x% more expensive. i.e. compounding interest on prices.
	levels:
		each time an action is performed, you receive an experience point.
		? the person also receives an experience point for that skill.
[ ] achievement when a thing is done for the first time?

Done

[x] store items should have an info icon that reveals their description.
[x] bugs don't exist until level 2...
[x] store: buy observation skills. 
[x] replace 'var ' with 'let '
[x] bug: shouldn't be able to select a 'busy' receiver or doer.
[x] when something is selected and it's wrong then de-select the previous thing. (be it doer or receiver)
[x] Board height should be limited.
[x] short series of tool tips for showing/hiding "next action"
		- start the game
		- buy a sales lead
		- click the founder, then click the lead (or vice versa).
		- click the founder then click a story

[x] when to show "buy person" button(s) ? When money first reaches minimum...

[x] select names from an array
[x] updating person: update card in place, don't remove.
[x] restore delay time factor. (avgDuration)

[x] when someone is busy, say what they are doing. (could be creative later.)
[x] give people names

[x] if something is delivered that has a bug... the customer finds it and gives it back... to be started over. gets angry customer icon.
[x] when developing, chance of finding a bug should be related to: 1. presence of bug, effectiveness of worker.
[x] when developing, chance of *creating* a bug should be related to: effectiveness of worker, size of card.

[x] each project... should also have a project logo. (random emoji)
	[x] that logo is displayed on its lead and subsequent stories
[x] instead of random time to move things... have it relate to # points / effectiveness of worker.
[x] project names could be generated using an algo. ()-().
[x] show the cash amount.
[x] when person is busy show that they are busy
[x] when person is busy they cannot be selected for task
[x] when task is busy it cannot be selected as receiver
[x] when things are 'done' they are delivered... get cash as a result. (Every time! not only when project is completed)
	[x] dollar is shown next to card... it dissappears off board after a few seconds. at which time money appears on board.
 ?  how do leads arrive? randomly? via advertising?
		[x] you buy them.
[x] top align cards in columns.



Unlikely:

[no] When you add something to the board. If it's the only thing on the board, then select that thing automatiucally.
