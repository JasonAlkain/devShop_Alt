 ?  is there inflation?
		each time a thing is purchased, that thing becomes x% more expensive. i.e. compounding interest on prices.
	levels:
		each time an action is performed, you receive an experience point.
		? the person also receives an experience point for that skill.
[ ] achievement when a thing is done for the first time?

Done
[x] Board height should be limited.

[x] short series of tool tips for showing/hiding "next action"

[x] when someone is busy, say what they are doing. (could be creative later.)
[x] give people names

[x] if something is delivered that has a bug... the customer finds it and gives it back... to be started over. gets angry customer icon.
[x] when developing, chance of finding a bug should be related to: 1. presence of bug, effectiveness of worker.
[x] when developing, chance of *creating* a bug should be related to: effectiveness of worker, size of card.

[x] each project... should also have a project logo. (random emoji)
	[x] that logo is displayed on its lead and subsequent stories
[x] instead of random time to move things... have it relate to # points / effectiveness of worker.
[x] project names could be generated using an algo. ()-().
[x] show the cash amount.
[x] when person is busy show that they are busy
[x] when person is busy they cannot be selected for task
[x] when task is busy it cannot be selected as receiver
[x] when things are 'done' they are delivered... get cash as a result. (Every time! not only when project is completed)
	[x] dollar is shown next to card... it dissappears off board after a few seconds. at which time money appears on board.
