Thomas ideas:

A few ideas

**definitely**

- Change request event, like the current bug event, which pulls a card from its current position, even finished, back to start.
--> difference is, it is an added story, not a recycled story, it takes BA time, it doesn't have a money decrease, but rather an increase.... although it does delay the completion bonus. Has different symbology/description. (How to trigger it, without worrying about a race condition regarding completion bonus?)

- Special abilities which you unlock over time and obtain charges of in some way, purchasing or as rewards, such as Bug Bash to rapidly get through a stack of bugs, or Mercenary which brings in a high-level super contractor for a single sprint.

--> bug bash... like a bonus round
--> 

- Occasional Tenders, which are like boss fights compared to normal projects. You have to put together the tender somehow, perhaps it's like a normal project but instead of rewarding money it rewards a tender application score that determines whether you win the tender. The tender itself is then a bigger more challenging version of a project with better rewards.

--> a tender item pays no money along the way, and only pays money if you win the tender and complete the project, but the project pays a premium (to make up for the tender cost)



**probably not**

- At the end of each project you choose a go live party option (random multiple activities with different costs), the option you pick determines the morale boost each employee gets in the first sprint of the next project.

- Adding complexity to above: each employee has activities they like (extra boost) and dislike (no boost).


- Traits for employees, so when choosing employees to hire you have to balance their salary, traits and current level. For example devs can have a Cowboy trait that increases dev speed but also bug chance. No stats like Game Dev Story, an employee just has a level and their traits.

NO: only one dog in the office.
No: only one cat in the office.

No: cat poops
No: dog poops
No: rename to 'tinykanban'



# DEFER
stats button lower right üìà : each person's skills and description. point per minute described for every minute of the game (excluded minutes with 0 points)

show scores and levels in hexadecimal????

[ ] achievement when a thing is done for the first time?


# DONE


[x] help button doesn't work
[x] slower increase in cost for store items.
no: button hover should be light blue
no: do we have an id issue when selecting storeitem's in store versus inbox? clash of id's?
[x] ensure chance of CREATING a bug or spec bug is lower for rework
[x] ensure level of skills is visible
no: test-management suite -- test level up
no: powerful IDE -- dev level up
no: spreadsheet skills -- be a better BA
no: email etiquette course -- be a better BA
no: when you buy a self-starter card (or any card) that should not be enough to kick off the self-starting behaviour. (or should it!?) (yes it should)
[x] icon to indicate has seat after seat upgrade: should show up on the person
[x] seat upgrade should make you more effective
[x] chance of finding a bug or specBug -- need to be same mathematical model as creating bug or spec bug
no: Limit dog/cat numbers
[x] if > 1, show skill level number top right of skill icon on person card.
[x] consider: the store should show level n+1 items, disabled.
[x] show next level items (disabled) before they are available (buttons in office, and in store)
[x] when new items added to store, show a little icon on the store button
[x] highlight store button to indicate when there are new things added to it. Unhighlight it when it is pressed.
[x] highlight button when enabled -- do this for all buttons that are created during level up. (e.g. buy dev)


[x] ability to see skill level
[x] dog/cat never seem to return!
[x] there is a 0% chance of finding it (spec bug)
[x] starting price of tester and dev should be 200 not 300
[x] add "piece of toast üçû $10"
[x] BA retained message after stopping rework on a specbug
[x] ensure Dog and cat are for "any" not just "ba" or "dev"
[x] every time you buy something it triples in price. Better idea! Not triple, but high price.
[x] store... put ICON before name
[x] Add  statue üóΩ
[x] Add   statue2 üóø
[x]  mechanical keyboard should be an early level item -- level up anyone
[x] When a .button is clicked at top, deselect doer or receiver and possible 
[x] mech keyboard should be added
[x] Price of staff should double each time. At least. If not 5x. Or 3x 

Memory management:
 When a project is complete:
   [x] Delete each of its stories from game.stories
   [x] Delete it from projects. 
[x] Initial dog cat duration double
[x] And double it every time there after 
[x]If money is negative then XP is not added to XP. Instead it is multiplied by -1 and added to money
[x] And lock in the per point price of the story (lead) when it is purchased then pass it into the children when. They are spawned. 
[x] When the customer finds a bug... the return of the card is immediately halved.



[x] Don't say idle if they are just waiting to self start
[x] Show self start icon 


[x] Shouldn't be able to select items that are in the done column
[x] instead of efficiency... have their skill level map so 1-10 is 0.3  0.4  ,0.5   ,0.6   ,0.77   ,0.83  ,0.90   ,0.95  ,0.99

[x] if have cat... less errors.
[x] if have dog... work faster.
 [x]  is there inflation?
		each time a thing is purchased, that thing becomes x% more expensive. i.e. compounding interest on prices.
	levels:
		each time an action is performed, you receive an experience point.
		? the person also receives an experience point for that skill.

[x] guillotine bug on iOS (table too tall basically)
[x] bugs can exist before level 2 - just can't be found by tester or customer (avoids a way of cheating/missing the point)
[x] rework on a bug should be quicker than original work.
[x] button text smaller, particularly at smaller sizes
[x] vertical-center content in .button
[x] store items should have an info icon that reveals their description.
[x] bugs don't exist until level 2...
[x] store: buy observation skills. 
[x] replace 'var ' with 'let '
[x] bug: shouldn't be able to select a 'busy' receiver or doer.
[x] when something is selected and it's wrong then de-select the previous thing. (be it doer or receiver)
[x] Board height should be limited.
[x] short series of tool tips for showing/hiding "next action"
		- start the game
		- buy a sales lead
		- click the founder, then click the lead (or vice versa).
		- click the founder then click a story

[x] when to show "buy person" button(s) ? When money first reaches minimum...

[x] select names from an array
[x] updating person: update card in place, don't remove.
[x] restore delay time factor. (avgDuration)

[x] when someone is busy, say what they are doing. (could be creative later.)
[x] give people names

[x] if something is delivered that has a bug... the customer finds it and gives it back... to be started over. gets angry customer icon.
[x] when developing, chance of finding a bug should be related to: 1. presence of bug, effectiveness of worker.
[x] when developing, chance of *creating* a bug should be related to: effectiveness of worker, size of card.

[x] each project... should also have a project logo. (random emoji)
	[x] that logo is displayed on its lead and subsequent stories
[x] instead of random time to move things... have it relate to # points / effectiveness of worker.
[x] project names could be generated using an algo. ()-().
[x] show the cash amount.
[x] when person is busy show that they are busy
[x] when person is busy they cannot be selected for task
[x] when task is busy it cannot be selected as receiver
[x] when things are 'done' they are delivered... get cash as a result. (Every time! not only when project is completed)
	[x] dollar is shown next to card... it dissappears off board after a few seconds. at which time money appears on board.
 ?  how do leads arrive? randomly? via advertising?
		[x] you buy them.
[x] top align cards in columns.


Answered/resolved (in a different topic)
// ? when purchasing a project... cannot go more than $100 * level into the red (?) or 100* #people ??
// ? When is interest added to the loan!?
//    after a certain amount of time.... (is it a turn based game or a time-based game?)
//      some things about it are time based... delays for example
//    whenever levelling up... whenever a story is finished? whenever an action occurs


Unlikely:

[no] When you add something to the board. If it's the only thing on the board, then select that thing automatiucally.
